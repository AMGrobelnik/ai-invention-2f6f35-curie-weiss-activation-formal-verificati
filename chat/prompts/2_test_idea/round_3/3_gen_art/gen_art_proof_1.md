<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: An artifact executor (Step 3.3: GEN_ART in the invention loop)

Executing a plan to produce a concrete artifact.
GEN_PAPER_TEXT will use your artifact in the next paper draft.

Rigorous artifact with clear results → strong paper. Sloppy artifact → misdirected research.

<critical_requirements>
- Use Lean 4 syntax (not Lean 3)
- No 'sorry' in final code — all proofs must be complete
</critical_requirements>

<common_mistakes_to_avoid>
- Check Nat vs Int vs Real types — Nat subtraction truncates at 0, Nat division is floor division, type coercions cause compiler errors

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

title: 'CWA Proof v3: Add Corollary 4b (J≤0.55) Covering Experimental Regime'
summary: >-
  Extend the verified iter-2 proof.lean by adding `cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55` — a concrete warm-start-3 bias bound for J≤55/100
  giving bias≤(167/1000)·ε≈16.7%·ε — which covers the experimentally observed J∈[0.515,0.521] range that the existing J≤1/2
  corollary misses. The proof is pure arithmetic reusing the existing `cwa_warmstart_bias` + `gcongr` + `norm_num` pattern.
  No existing theorems are modified.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_light
informal_proof_draft: |-
  ## Goal
  Add one new theorem `cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55` after the existing `cwa_warmstart3_concrete` in proof.lean.

  ## Starting Point
  Copy the COMPLETE verified proof.lean from iter-2 (path: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_6gT5lHFn8559/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_art/gen_art_proof_1/proof.lean`) verbatim as the base. Do NOT modify any existing lemma or theorem — only append the new one.

  ## New Theorem to Add

  Insert immediately after `cwa_warmstart3_concrete` (line 255 in iter-2) and before the `-- ====` separator of `cwa_main_v2`:

  ```lean
  -- Corollary 4b: warm-start-3 bias ≤ J³·ε ≤ (55/100)³·ε ≤ (167/1000)·ε when J ≤ 55/100
  -- experimental J∈[0.515,0.521], J^3∈[0.137,0.141], covered by this corollary
  theorem cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55 (x : ℝ) {J : ℝ} (hJ0 : 0 < J) (hJ_55 : J ≤ 55/100)
      {m_star : ℝ} (hstar : Real.tanh (x + J * m_star) = m_star)
      {m_hat : ℝ} {ε : ℝ} (hε : 0 ≤ ε)
      (hinit : |m_hat - m_star| ≤ ε) :
      |(fun m => Real.tanh (x + J * m))^[3] m_hat - m_star| ≤ (167/1000) * ε := by
    have hJ1 : J < 1 := by linarith
    have h3 := cwa_warmstart_bias x hJ0 hJ1 hstar hε hinit 3
    have hJ3 : J ^ 3 ≤ (55/100 : ℝ) ^ 3 := by gcongr
    have h55_3 : (55/100 : ℝ) ^ 3 ≤ 167/1000 := by norm_num
    calc |(fun m => Real.tanh (x + J * m))^[3] m_hat - m_star|
        ≤ J ^ 3 * ε := h3
      _ ≤ (55/100 : ℝ) ^ 3 * ε := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right hJ3 hε
      _ ≤ (167/1000) * ε := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right h55_3 hε
  ```

  ## Key Arithmetic Fact
  (55/100)^3 = 166375/1000000 ≤ 167/1000 = 167000/1000000.
  norm_num handles this directly over ℚ/ℝ. No manual computation required.

  For hJ3: `gcongr` works because hJ_55 : J ≤ 55/100 and hJ0 : 0 < J, giving J^3 ≤ (55/100)^3.
  For h55_3: `norm_num` closes it immediately.
  The calc chain: three steps, each step a `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right` application with hε.

  ## Verification Steps
  1. Use `aii-lean` skill to compile the modified proof.lean.
  2. Expected output: zero errors, zero warnings about `sorry`.
  3. All prior theorems (cwa_banach, ift_gradient_correct, cwa_ift_bias_code_tolerance, code_tol_bound_finite, warmstart_iteration_bound, cwa_warmstart_bias, cwa_warmstart3_concrete, cwa_main_v2) should still compile unchanged.
  4. The new `cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55` should compile as well.

  ## Fallback Tactic Alternatives (if above fails)
  - If `gcongr` fails for `J^3 ≤ (55/100)^3`: replace with `apply pow_le_pow_left (le_of_lt hJ0) hJ_55`
  - If `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right` API differs: try `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right h55_3 hε` → `by apply mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right h55_3 hε`
  - Alternative single-step proof: combine both steps into `nlinarith [pow_le_pow_left (le_of_lt hJ0) hJ_55 3, hε]` if calc chain is problematic
  - Full norm_num fallback for h55_3: `norm_num` should unconditionally close `(55:ℝ)/100 ^ 3 ≤ 167/1000`; alternatively `decide` won't work on ℝ but `norm_num` will

  ## Output Files
  - `proof.lean`: complete file = iter-2 content + new theorem appended before cwa_main_v2's section header
  - `proof_out.json`: schema `{verified: true, has_sorries: false, proof_successful: true, lean_code: "<full file contents>", proof_explanation: "<string>", lemmas: [{name, statement, compiler_out, is_compiler_verified, tactic}, ...], new_lemmas: ["cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55"]}`

  All 15 lemmas from iter-2 plus the new one (16 total) must appear in the `lemmas` array with `is_compiler_verified: true`.
explanation: |-
  The iter-2 proof established `cwa_warmstart3_concrete` covering J≤1/2 (bias≤12.5%·ε). However, the actual experiments report J∈[0.515,0.521] — strictly above 0.5 — so the existing corollary is formally inapplicable to the experimental parameters. This creates a minor but real reviewer-visible inconsistency: the paper claims warm-start-3 has bounded bias for the observed coupling values, but the only concrete Lean theorem that instantiates this bound applies to J≤0.5, not J≈0.52.

  Corollary 4b (`cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55`) fixes this by providing a verified bound for J≤0.55, which covers the entire experimentally observed range [0.515,0.521] with margin. The bound is (167/1000)·ε≈16.7%·ε vs 12.5%·ε for J≤0.5 — slightly looser but still demonstrates that 3 warm-start steps reduce initialization error to <17%, which is negligible relative to training noise.

  The proof construction is minimal and high-confidence: it directly reuses `cwa_warmstart_bias` (already verified), `gcongr` for monotone power bounds (established pattern from `cwa_warmstart3_concrete`), and `norm_num` for the rational arithmetic inequality (55/100)^3≤167/1000. The probability of compilation failure is extremely low given the exact same tactic pattern succeeded for the J≤1/2 case. Total expected effort: ~10 minutes including verification iteration.

title: 'CWA: DEQ IFT Backward, p_c Derivation, SELU, 2025-2026 Survey'
summary: |-
  This research artifact provides four concrete bodies of verified technical knowledge for implementing the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA) in the GPU experiment.

  **1. DEQ IFT Backward (arXiv:1909.01377, 2310.18605):** The DEQ backward pass solves the linear system (I - J_f^T)g = ∂L/∂z* via fixed-point iteration using vector-Jacobian products (autograd.grad VJPs), avoiding O(K·n) memory from unrolled backprop and achieving O(n) per step. Crucially, because CWA's fixed point is SCALAR (m* ∈ R, not R^n), this system collapses to a closed-form scalar formula g = y/(1 - J·s̄) where s̄ = mean(sech²(x + J·m*)). No iterative backward solver is needed for CWA. Exact gradient formulas are derived: ∂m*/∂x_i = sech²(x_i+J·m*)/(n(1-J·s̄)); ∂m*/∂J = m*·s̄/(1-J·s̄); ∂y_i/∂J = sech²(x_i+J·m*)·m*/(1-J·s̄). A full efficient O(n) backward implementation is provided.

  **2. Competing Nonlinearities p_c (arXiv:2605.05294):** The critical mixing fraction for a Tanh/Swish incoherent statistical mixture is p_c = 32/35 ≈ 0.914 analytically (K₀→0 limit), derived from g₂^(Tanh)=-2 and g₂^(Swish)=3/16 via Eq. 17: p_c = g₂^(Tanh)/(g₂^(Tanh) - g₂^(Swish)). Empirically p_c ≈ 0.83 at K₀=1. Convention confirmed: p = fraction of SWISH neurons. Perturbative correction: p_c(K₀) = 32/35 - (384/1225)·K₀ + O(K₀²). For non-standard architectures (ResNet, GPT, C_W≠1), analytical p_c is unavailable — use empirical forward-pass calibration.

  **3. SELU Derivation (arXiv:1706.02515):** α₀₁ ≈ 1.6732632423543772, λ₀₁ ≈ 1.0507009873554805 from closed-form equations (Eq. 14). Fixed point (μ,ν)=(0,1) of the distributional mapping g:(μ,ν)→(E[SELU(z)], Var[SELU(z)]) for z~N(μ,ν), with weights N(0,1/n) (LeCun init). Banach fixed-point theorem on domain Ω proves contraction. Mechanistic contrast: SELU is pointwise (no inter-neuron coupling); CWA couples all neurons via the scalar mean-field m*.

  **4. 2025-2026 Novelty Survey:** Five papers assessed. No paper introduces a learnable scalar J coupling within-sample neuron mean to individual pre-activations in an activation function. Boltzmann Attention (2606.12478) uses Ising couplings in the sequence/attention dimension (not hidden); Competing Nonlinearities (2605.05294) uses a fixed (unlearnable) quenched mixture; AlphaEvolve activations (2602.05688) use batch statistics (cross-data, not within-sample); Tuning Universality (2512.00168) and Mean Field Feature Learning (2510.15174) are analysis frameworks with no learnable coupling. CWA's within-sample self-consistent mean-field activation with learnable J is confirmed novel.

- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-lean, aii-json.
TODO 2. Read the exp_proof_out schema from the aii-json skill for output format. Include everything in artifact plan; you may also prove additional lemmas/properties. Analyze the theorem: proof type (definitional equality, induction, algebraic, case analysis), mathematical domain (number theory, algebra, combinatorics, analysis), required imports (Mathlib.Tactic, BigOperators, etc.). Note if division should be avoided (use multiplication form).
TODO 3. VERIFY SMALL CASES: Where possible, write code (e.g., a short Python script) that computationally verifies the conjecture for small cases (small n, small structures) BEFORE attempting the general proof — empirical confirmation is evidence the statement is true as formalized, and a counterexample means the statement or its formalization is wrong and must be fixed first, saving a doomed proof attempt. Do the same for candidate intermediate lemmas when cheap.
TODO 4. SEARCH: Search Mathlib using aii-lean skill's semantic and pattern search. Run multiple searches in parallel — note useful lemmas, theorems, and tactics.
TODO 5. DECOMPOSE: Identify useful intermediate lemmas before tackling the main theorem.
TODO 6. SKETCH: Write the full proof structure with `sorry` placeholders for all lemmas and the main theorem. Verify it compiles — this confirms the overall logic is sound.
TODO 7. PROVE LEMMAS: Tackle `sorry`s one by one. Be meticulous and exhaustive — spend significant effort on each lemma. For each: search Mathlib for related proofs, try multiple tactics (ring, simp, omega, linarith, nlinarith), explore alternative formulations. Use `calc` blocks for equality proofs. Break into smaller sub-lemmas if needed. Prove independently using `lemma` keyword. Keep proved lemmas — they can be reused across attempts. If a lemma fails 3+ times, consider if it's actually true or needs a different approach.
TODO 8. PROVE THEOREM: Replace the main theorem's `sorry` using `theorem` keyword and apply proved lemmas. Search Mathlib for related theorems that could help. Be thorough — try every combination of proved lemmas, tactics, and alternative approaches before giving up. If you can see how it would work with different lemmas, go back and re-sketch and prove the new lemmas.
TODO 9. VERIFY: Test the complete proof with aii-lean skill. If errors, fix syntax/type errors, add missing imports, re-verify after each fix. If verified=true and no `sorry` remains, consider your task completed.
TODO 10. SELF-SUMMARIZE: What worked? What failed? What to try next?
TODO 11. RETRY OR PIVOT: Fix failed lemmas and retry. If still failing, try completely different proof strategy (definitional equality, induction, algebraic, case analysis, direct), different type representation, stronger/weaker intermediate lemmas. Search Mathlib again. If multiple lemmas keep failing, pivot — go back to the SEARCH step with a completely different proof approach. If theorem appears unprovable after exhaustive attempts, document specific reasons why and note which sub-lemmas ARE provable (partial progress). IMPORTANT: Keep proved lemmas in your "lemma pool" — don't discard working code. Hard-to-prove lemmas are often crucial to the final proof.

---

**IMPORTANT - Path resolution:** Always use an absolute SKILL_DIR. The CWD may not be the project root (e.g. on worker pods).
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-lean"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```
GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` and **single-quoted** command templates.

## Workflow: Sorry-Driven Proof Development

The standard mathematician workflow for formalizing proofs in Lean 4:

### Step 1: Formalize the Statement
Write the theorem signature — what you want to prove:
```lean
import Mathlib.Tactic

theorem my_theorem (x y : Int) (h : x < y) : x + 1 ≤ y := by
  sorry
```

### Step 2: Search Mathlib for Relevant Lemmas
Find existing theorems by type pattern via Loogle:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-lean" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_mathlib_pattern_search.py "Int.lt_iff_add_one_le"
```

### Step 3: Try Tactics at Sorry Positions
Submit code with sorry and let the suggest tool try tactics:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-lean" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_lean_suggest.py \
  --code "import Mathlib.Tactic
theorem ex : 1 + 1 = 2 := by sorry" \
  --tactics "exact?,simp?,omega,ring"
```

Returns goals at each sorry and which tactics close them.

### Step 4: Fill Sorrys Iteratively
Replace each sorry with the tactic that worked. Sorrys can be filled in any order — each is independent. For complex proofs, break into sub-lemmas with their own sorrys.

### Step 5: Verify Complete Proof
Compile the full proof — a clean compile with no sorrys means done:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-lean" && \
echo 'import Mathlib.Tactic
theorem ex (x y : Int) (h : x < y) : x + 1 ≤ y := by linarith' | $SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_run_lean.py -
```

`verified: true` = proof is complete and correct.

**Query patterns:**
- By constant: `Real.sin`
- By name substring: `"differ"`
- By subexpression: `_ * (_ ^ _)`
- Non-linear: `Real.sqrt ?a * Real.sqrt ?a`
- By conclusion: `|- tsum _ = _ * tsum _`
- Multiple filters: `Real.sin, "two", _ * _`

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required) — Type pattern query
- `--limit, -n` — Number of results (default: 10)
- `--timeout, -t` — Timeout in seconds (default: 30)

**Tip:** Pure type queries like `Nat → Nat` timeout — add a constant: `Nat.succ, Nat → Nat`

## Mathlib Tactics Reference

Mathlib is always enabled (Lean v4.14.0). Common tactics:

**Automation (close goals directly):**
- `ring` — Polynomial ring equations
- `linarith` — Linear arithmetic over ordered fields
- `nlinarith` — Nonlinear arithmetic
- `omega` — Integer/natural linear arithmetic (decision procedure)
- `decide` — Decidable propositions
- `norm_num` — Numeric normalization
- `simp` — Simplifier with extensible lemma set
- `aesop` — General proof search (best-first)

**Discovery (find what lemma/tactic to use):**
- `exact?` — Find a single lemma that closes the goal
- `apply?` — Find a lemma that applies (may leave subgoals)
- `rw?` — Find rewrite lemmas for subterms
- `simp?` — Run simplifier and report which lemmas fired

**Examples:**
```lean
import Mathlib.Tactic

-- ring closes polynomial identities
example (x y : Int) : (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2*x*y + y^2 := by ring

-- linarith closes linear inequalities
example (x y : Int) (h1 : x < y) (h2 : y < x + 3) : y - x < 3 := by linarith

-- omega handles Nat/Int linear arithmetic
example (n : Nat) (h : n ≥ 2) : n * n ≥ 4 := by omega
```

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-json
description: JSON validation and formatting toolkit. Validate JSON files against schemas for experiment pipelines, and generate full/mini/preview versions of JSON datasets. Use for validating pipeline outputs, checking schema compliance, or creating size-optimized JSON variants.
---

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**
- `sel_hypo_out.json` - Hypothesis Selection output (all hypotheses with selected flags)
- `feasibility_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with feasibility scores
- `feasibility_eval_top.json` - Top 5 most feasible hypotheses
- `novelty_research_one.json` - Single hypothesis novelty research arguments with citations
- `novelty_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with novelty scores
- `novelty_eval_top.json` - Single best selected hypothesis

**Experiment Pipeline:**
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format

---

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

title: 'CWA Proof v3: Add Corollary 4b (J≤0.55) Covering Experimental Regime'
summary: >-
  Extend the verified iter-2 proof.lean by adding `cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55` — a concrete warm-start-3 bias bound for J≤55/100
  giving bias≤(167/1000)·ε≈16.7%·ε — which covers the experimentally observed J∈[0.515,0.521] range that the existing J≤1/2
  corollary misses. The proof is pure arithmetic reusing the existing `cwa_warmstart_bias` + `gcongr` + `norm_num` pattern.
  No existing theorems are modified.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_light
informal_proof_draft: |-
  ## Goal
  Add one new theorem `cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55` after the existing `cwa_warmstart3_concrete` in proof.lean.

  ## Starting Point
  Copy the COMPLETE verified proof.lean from iter-2 (path: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_6gT5lHFn8559/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_art/gen_art_proof_1/proof.lean`) verbatim as the base. Do NOT modify any existing lemma or theorem — only append the new one.

  ## New Theorem to Add

  Insert immediately after `cwa_warmstart3_concrete` (line 255 in iter-2) and before the `-- ====` separator of `cwa_main_v2`:

  ```lean
  -- Corollary 4b: warm-start-3 bias ≤ J³·ε ≤ (55/100)³·ε ≤ (167/1000)·ε when J ≤ 55/100
  -- experimental J∈[0.515,0.521], J^3∈[0.137,0.141], covered by this corollary
  theorem cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55 (x : ℝ) {J : ℝ} (hJ0 : 0 < J) (hJ_55 : J ≤ 55/100)
      {m_star : ℝ} (hstar : Real.tanh (x + J * m_star) = m_star)
      {m_hat : ℝ} {ε : ℝ} (hε : 0 ≤ ε)
      (hinit : |m_hat - m_star| ≤ ε) :
      |(fun m => Real.tanh (x + J * m))^[3] m_hat - m_star| ≤ (167/1000) * ε := by
    have hJ1 : J < 1 := by linarith
    have h3 := cwa_warmstart_bias x hJ0 hJ1 hstar hε hinit 3
    have hJ3 : J ^ 3 ≤ (55/100 : ℝ) ^ 3 := by gcongr
    have h55_3 : (55/100 : ℝ) ^ 3 ≤ 167/1000 := by norm_num
    calc |(fun m => Real.tanh (x + J * m))^[3] m_hat - m_star|
        ≤ J ^ 3 * ε := h3
      _ ≤ (55/100 : ℝ) ^ 3 * ε := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right hJ3 hε
      _ ≤ (167/1000) * ε := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right h55_3 hε
  ```

  ## Key Arithmetic Fact
  (55/100)^3 = 166375/1000000 ≤ 167/1000 = 167000/1000000.
  norm_num handles this directly over ℚ/ℝ. No manual computation required.

  For hJ3: `gcongr` works because hJ_55 : J ≤ 55/100 and hJ0 : 0 < J, giving J^3 ≤ (55/100)^3.
  For h55_3: `norm_num` closes it immediately.
  The calc chain: three steps, each step a `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right` application with hε.

  ## Verification Steps
  1. Use `aii-lean` skill to compile the modified proof.lean.
  2. Expected output: zero errors, zero warnings about `sorry`.
  3. All prior theorems (cwa_banach, ift_gradient_correct, cwa_ift_bias_code_tolerance, code_tol_bound_finite, warmstart_iteration_bound, cwa_warmstart_bias, cwa_warmstart3_concrete, cwa_main_v2) should still compile unchanged.
  4. The new `cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55` should compile as well.

  ## Fallback Tactic Alternatives (if above fails)
  - If `gcongr` fails for `J^3 ≤ (55/100)^3`: replace with `apply pow_le_pow_left (le_of_lt hJ0) hJ_55`
  - If `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right` API differs: try `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right h55_3 hε` → `by apply mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right h55_3 hε`
  - Alternative single-step proof: combine both steps into `nlinarith [pow_le_pow_left (le_of_lt hJ0) hJ_55 3, hε]` if calc chain is problematic
  - Full norm_num fallback for h55_3: `norm_num` should unconditionally close `(55:ℝ)/100 ^ 3 ≤ 167/1000`; alternatively `decide` won't work on ℝ but `norm_num` will

  ## Output Files
  - `proof.lean`: complete file = iter-2 content + new theorem appended before cwa_main_v2's section header
  - `proof_out.json`: schema `{verified: true, has_sorries: false, proof_successful: true, lean_code: "<full file contents>", proof_explanation: "<string>", lemmas: [{name, statement, compiler_out, is_compiler_verified, tactic}, ...], new_lemmas: ["cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55"]}`

  All 15 lemmas from iter-2 plus the new one (16 total) must appear in the `lemmas` array with `is_compiler_verified: true`.
explanation: |-
  The iter-2 proof established `cwa_warmstart3_concrete` covering J≤1/2 (bias≤12.5%·ε). However, the actual experiments report J∈[0.515,0.521] — strictly above 0.5 — so the existing corollary is formally inapplicable to the experimental parameters. This creates a minor but real reviewer-visible inconsistency: the paper claims warm-start-3 has bounded bias for the observed coupling values, but the only concrete Lean theorem that instantiates this bound applies to J≤0.5, not J≈0.52.

  Corollary 4b (`cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55`) fixes this by providing a verified bound for J≤0.55, which covers the entire experimentally observed range [0.515,0.521] with margin. The bound is (167/1000)·ε≈16.7%·ε vs 12.5%·ε for J≤0.5 — slightly looser but still demonstrates that 3 warm-start steps reduce initialization error to <17%, which is negligible relative to training noise.

  The proof construction is minimal and high-confidence: it directly reuses `cwa_warmstart_bias` (already verified), `gcongr` for monotone power bounds (established pattern from `cwa_warmstart3_concrete`), and `norm_num` for the rational arithmetic inequality (55/100)^3≤167/1000. The probability of compilation failure is extremely low given the exact same tactic pattern succeeded for the J≤1/2 case. Total expected effort: ~10 minutes including verification iteration.

title: 'CWA: DEQ IFT Backward, p_c Derivation, SELU, 2025-2026 Survey'
summary: |-
  This research artifact provides four concrete bodies of verified technical knowledge for implementing the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA) in the GPU experiment.

  **1. DEQ IFT Backward (arXiv:1909.01377, 2310.18605):** The DEQ backward pass solves the linear system (I - J_f^T)g = ∂L/∂z* via fixed-point iteration using vector-Jacobian products (autograd.grad VJPs), avoiding O(K·n) memory from unrolled backprop and achieving O(n) per step. Crucially, because CWA's fixed point is SCALAR (m* ∈ R, not R^n), this system collapses to a closed-form scalar formula g = y/(1 - J·s̄) where s̄ = mean(sech²(x + J·m*)). No iterative backward solver is needed for CWA. Exact gradient formulas are derived: ∂m*/∂x_i = sech²(x_i+J·m*)/(n(1-J·s̄)); ∂m*/∂J = m*·s̄/(1-J·s̄); ∂y_i/∂J = sech²(x_i+J·m*)·m*/(1-J·s̄). A full efficient O(n) backward implementation is provided.

  **2. Competing Nonlinearities p_c (arXiv:2605.05294):** The critical mixing fraction for a Tanh/Swish incoherent statistical mixture is p_c = 32/35 ≈ 0.914 analytically (K₀→0 limit), derived from g₂^(Tanh)=-2 and g₂^(Swish)=3/16 via Eq. 17: p_c = g₂^(Tanh)/(g₂^(Tanh) - g₂^(Swish)). Empirically p_c ≈ 0.83 at K₀=1. Convention confirmed: p = fraction of SWISH neurons. Perturbative correction: p_c(K₀) = 32/35 - (384/1225)·K₀ + O(K₀²). For non-standard architectures (ResNet, GPT, C_W≠1), analytical p_c is unavailable — use empirical forward-pass calibration.

  **3. SELU Derivation (arXiv:1706.02515):** α₀₁ ≈ 1.6732632423543772, λ₀₁ ≈ 1.0507009873554805 from closed-form equations (Eq. 14). Fixed point (μ,ν)=(0,1) of the distributional mapping g:(μ,ν)→(E[SELU(z)], Var[SELU(z)]) for z~N(μ,ν), with weights N(0,1/n) (LeCun init). Banach fixed-point theorem on domain Ω proves contraction. Mechanistic contrast: SELU is pointwise (no inter-neuron coupling); CWA couples all neurons via the scalar mean-field m*.

  **4. 2025-2026 Novelty Survey:** Five papers assessed. No paper introduces a learnable scalar J coupling within-sample neuron mean to individual pre-activations in an activation function. Boltzmann Attention (2606.12478) uses Ising couplings in the sequence/attention dimension (not hidden); Competing Nonlinearities (2605.05294) uses a fixed (unlearnable) quenched mixture; AlphaEvolve activations (2602.05688) use batch statistics (cross-data, not within-sample); Tuning Universality (2512.00168) and Mean Field Feature Learning (2510.15174) are analysis frameworks with no learnable coupling. CWA's within-sample self-consistent mean-field activation with learnable J is confirmed novel.

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. **FINAL TESTING PHASE**: Re-verify the complete proof one more time with aii_run_lean.py. Check that verified=true and has_sorries=false. If any errors remain, fix them. Ensure the proof is complete without any 'sorry' placeholders.
TODO 2. Save the complete Lean 4 code to './proof.lean'. Create './proof_out.json' following the exp_proof_out schema from the aii-json skill exactly:
- proof_successful: true/false
- verified: true/false (from aii_run_lean.py result)
- lean_code: complete Lean 4 code as string
- proof_explanation: explanation of proof strategy
- lemmas: array of {name, statement, compiler_out, is_compiler_verified, tactic} for each lemma
- approaches_tried: array of {approach, reason_failed} if proof failed
- error_messages: array of final error messages if proof failed
TODO 3. Use 'ls' to verify ./proof.lean and ./proof_out.json exist in your workspace.

Attempt 1 failed validation.

Schema validation found 1 problem — fix ALL of them at once:
  - at `layman_summary`: 'This artifact extends a formally verified mathematical proof that a novel neural network activation function (CWA) converges correctly, adding a new theorem that explicitly covers the experimentally observed coupling parameter range J∈[0.515,0.521] with a verified bias bound of ≤16.7%·ε after 3 warm-start iterations.' is too long (at most 250 characters, got 318)
Every required field must be present and every field type must match the schema.

Please use the Write tool to overwrite `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` with corrected JSON. Do not invent new fields; match the schema you were given.
