# Introduction

Activation functions in neural networks have traditionally been designed pointwise: each neuron's output $y_i$ depends only on its own pre-activation $x_i$, independent of other neurons in the same layer. This architectural independence requires external normalization layers — BatchNorm [8] or LayerNorm [9] — or precise initialization schemes [3, 4] to maintain stable gradient flow across depth. Three practically important settings make such requirements burdensome: (a)~on-device inference, where normalization's running statistics incur memory and quantization distortion; (b)~physics-informed neural networks, where normalization disrupts conservation laws encoded in the activations [5]; and (c)~fast-inference transformer variants that eliminate LayerNorm to reduce memory bandwidth.

The *edge of chaos* in deep networks — the boundary where layer Jacobian singular values are near unity — correlates empirically with fast training and good generalization [3, 4]. Existing approaches achieve criticality only at initialization via weight variance tuning [3, 4] or static random activation mixtures [5], with no mechanism to track criticality adaptively during training. The Curie-Weiss model of ferromagnetism [15] provides a natural template for an adaptive mechanism: each spin aligns with the mean field of its neighbors, $m = \tanh(\beta(h + J\cdot m))$, with a critical point at $\beta J = 1$ where magnetic susceptibility diverges. Transferring this structure to neural activations gives $y_i = \tanh(x_i + J\cdot\overline{y})$, coupling all neurons in a layer through a learnable scalar $J$.

This paper reports a complete experimental investigation of the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA). **We position CWA as a mechanistic negative-results study**: we propose the activation, establish its formal mathematical properties, demonstrate IFT memory efficiency at scale, and then provide a precise account of why CWA fails to deliver its intended benefits under standard training. This honest investigation is itself a scientific contribution — the sech$^2$ saturation barrier we identify is the reason no prior adaptive criticality mechanism has succeeded in the mean-field activation setting, and characterizing it precisely opens the path to future solutions.

[FIGURE:fig1]

## Summary of Contributions

- **Formally verified mathematical foundation** (Section~3): Five Lean~4 theorems without \texttt{sorry} — fixed-point existence, IFT gradient correctness, adaptive bias bound, warm-start-T bias, and new Corollary~4b (J $\leq$ 0.55, bias $\leq$ 16.7\%$\cdot\varepsilon$) covering the experimentally observed J $\in$ [0.515, 0.521] [ARTIFACT:art_l4KqMWHu-dCe].
- **IFT memory efficiency confirmed at scale** (Section~4.1): A dedicated large-scale benchmark (n $\in$ {256, 1024, 4096}) confirms the IFT backward uses O($n$) memory: at n = 4096, IFT uses 23.3\,MB versus 75.8\,MB for unrolled K=50 (3.25$\times$ savings, 69\% reduction) [ARTIFACT:art_xd3tmcyckf00].
- **Gradient underflow, not balance** (Section~4.2): Using the corrected $|{\rm ratio}-1|$ distance-to-ideal metric, CWA ranks last at all tested depths. CWA's gradient ratio of 0.305 at depth 6 indicates *underflow* (2.4$\times$ worse than GELU, 7.8$\times$ worse than SELU). At depth 20, CWA collapses catastrophically (ratio $= 11.02$) [ARTIFACT:art_W-Ea4lflZ84v].
- **Complete null result** (Section~4.3): CWA provides no statistically significant accuracy gain over pointwise Tanh ($p = 0.126$), and the self-consistent coupling adds zero benefit over a detached mean-shift ($p = 0.984$) [ARTIFACT:art_5zKSer_FGOKx].
- **sech$^2$ saturation identified as root cause** (Section~5): $J\cdot\bar{s}$ remains at 0.20--0.41 under all tested configurations because sech$^2(x)\approx 0.07$ at typical activation magnitudes, preventing self-organized criticality regardless of J magnitude.


# Background and Related Work

**Edge-of-chaos criticality.** Poole et al. [3] showed that infinite-depth networks initialized at the order-chaos boundary exhibit depth-independent gradient propagation, characterized by a unit Jacobian spectral radius. Yang and Schoenholz [4] extended this analysis to residual networks. Both methods fix the criticality condition at initialization through weight variance tuning; the property drifts during training. CWA introduces a per-layer learnable scalar J intended to maintain near-critical coupling adaptively, but experiments establish that the path to $J\cdot\bar{s} = 1$ is blocked by sech$^2$ saturation at realistic activation scales (Section~5).

**Self-normalizing networks.** SELU [2] achieves self-normalization without external normalization by designing the activation's distributional fixed point to have mean 0 and variance 1. SELU is strictly pointwise. CWA couples all neurons within a layer via the mean-field term $J\cdot\overline{y}$, making it categorically distinct. Empirically, SELU achieves the best gradient stability at all tested depths ($|{\rm ratio}-1| = 0.089$, $0.129$, $0.471$ at depths 6, 10, 20) and the best accuracy at depth 20 ($0.535$ vs. CWA's $0.141$), suggesting that distributional fixed-point design is more effective than mean-field output coupling for unnormalized deep networks.

**Static activation mixtures.** Lesser and Chowdhury [5] achieve edge-of-chaos criticality by drawing each neuron's activation from a tanh/Swish mixture at analytically derived critical mixing fraction $p_c \approx 0.83$ (empirically calibrated at $K_0 = 1$). This approach requires no learnable parameter and no inter-neuron coupling. CWA provides a learnable J but fails to achieve near-critical $J\cdot\bar{s}$ under standard training; static critical mixtures remain a competitive baseline.

**Deep Equilibrium Models.** Bai et al. [1] showed that any infinite-depth weight-tied network can be computed via fixed-point root-finding, with IFT providing O(1) activation memory. The CWA IFT backward (Section~3.2) is directly inspired by DEQ but reduces to a closed-form scalar formula — because CWA's fixed point $m^* \in \mathbb{R}$ rather than $\mathbb{R}^n$ — eliminating iterative backward solvers. TorchDEQ [12] provides the broader DEQ ecosystem [ARTIFACT:art_Lj-xi6yJR_yy].

**Mean-field theory of activations.** Milletarì et al. [7] provided post-hoc physical interpretations of standard pointwise activations as solutions to energy-based models. CWA instead proposes a new activation *defined by* the Curie-Weiss self-consistency equation with a learnable J, introducing within-layer coupling absent from all prior derived activations.

**Boltzmann Attention.** Kim and Park [6] introduced learnable Ising couplings $J_{jk}$ between sequence positions in the attention operator. Boltzmann Attention and CWA are complementary: the former operates in the sequence dimension; the latter in the hidden dimension of the activation function.

**Mining activation functions.** Vitvitskyi et al. [13] and Ghavasieh [14] search for or analyze novel activation functions via evolutionary and statistical-mechanics methods, respectively. Neither proposes within-sample self-consistent mean-field coupling with a learnable scalar.


# Method: Curie-Weiss Activation

## Definition and Forward Pass

The Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA) for a layer with pre-activations $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as the unique fixed point of the scalar mean-field self-consistency equation:
$$m^* = \overline{\tanh}(\mathbf{x} + J\cdot m^*)$$
where $\overline{\cdot}$ denotes the mean over the $n$ neurons within a single sample (not the mini-batch), $J = \sigma(J_{\rm raw}) \in (0,1)$ is a per-layer learnable scalar, and the layer output is $y_i = \tanh(x_i + J\cdot m^*)$. The effective coupling $J\cdot\bar{s} = J\cdot\overline{\text{sech}^2(\mathbf{x}+J\cdot m^*)}$ simultaneously quantifies: (i) the per-step convergence rate $\rho$ of the fixed-point iteration; (ii) the spectral norm of the layer's input-output Jacobian; and (iii) proximity to the critical point $J\cdot\bar{s} = 1$.

The fixed-point iteration $m_{t+1} = \overline{\tanh}(\mathbf{x} + J\cdot m_t)$ is initialized at $m_0 = 0$ and terminated when $|m_{t+1} - m_t| < \delta(J\cdot\bar{s}) = 10^{-4}\cdot(1 - J\cdot\bar{s})$, with $K_{\max} = 50$. In experiments, $J\cdot\bar{s} \approx 0.20$--$0.40$, giving typical convergence in $K_{\rm mean} \approx 7.4$ iterations with 100\% of forward passes converging before $K_{\max}$. The sigmoid parameterization $J = \sigma(J_{\rm raw})$ hard-constrains $J$ below the ferromagnetic phase transition at $J = 1$, guaranteeing global convergence for all inputs.

## Hybrid IFT/Warm-Start Backpropagation

CWA uses a hybrid backward strategy determined by the forward-pass effective coupling $J\cdot\bar{s}$. When $J\cdot\bar{s} < 0.8$, a warm-start approximation is used: $K$ forward iterations run without gradient tracking to find $m^*$, followed by $T = 3$ tracked iterations from the detached $m^*$, with gradient bias bounded by $J^T \cdot \varepsilon$ (Theorem~4). When $J\cdot\bar{s} \geq 0.8$, a custom \texttt{torch.autograd.Function} applies the closed-form IFT gradient:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} = s_i\cdot\left[g_i + \frac{J\cdot\sum_k g_k s_k}{n(1 - J\cdot\bar{s})}\right], \qquad \frac{\partial L}{\partial J} = \frac{\sum_i g_i s_i \cdot m^*}{1 - J\cdot\bar{s}}$$
where $s_i = \text{sech}^2(x_i + J\cdot m^*)$ and $g_i = \partial L/\partial y_i$. The IFT path requires only O($n$) activation memory — storing the converged scalar $m^*$ — analogously to DEQ's memory reduction [1].

## Formal Verification in Lean 4

Five properties of CWA are formally verified in Lean~4 + Mathlib~v4.14.0 without \texttt{sorry} [ARTIFACT:art_l4KqMWHu-dCe]. The standard Mathlib \texttt{DerivHyp} module is broken in v4.14.0; all \texttt{HasDerivAt} results for sinh, cosh, tanh are derived from first principles via \texttt{HasDerivAt.inv} and \texttt{HasDerivAt.mul}.

**Theorem 1 (Banach Convergence).** For any $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $J \in (0,1)$, there exists a unique $m^*$ satisfying $\tanh(x + J\cdot m^*) = m^*$. *Proof:* tanh is 1-Lipschitz; composition with $J$-Lipschitz affine map gives $F$ $J$-Lipschitz; \texttt{ContractingWith.fixedPoint\_isFixedPt} + \texttt{fixedPoint\_unique} give existence and uniqueness.

**Theorem 2 (IFT Gradient).** With $\bar{s} = 1 - \tanh^2(x + J\cdot m^*)$ and $g = \bar{s}/(1 - J\cdot\bar{s})$, the identity $\bar{s}\cdot(1 + J\cdot g) = g$ holds. *Proof:* \texttt{field\_simp} after establishing $1 - J\cdot\bar{s} > 0$.

**Theorem 3 (Revised Bias Bound).** If $|F(m_{\rm approx}) - m_{\rm approx}| \leq 10^{-4}\cdot(1 - J\cdot\bar{s})$, then $|m_{\rm approx} - m^*| \leq 10^{-4}/(1-J)$. For $J \approx 0.52$, this bound is $\approx 2.08\times 10^{-4}$.

**Theorem 4 (Warm-Start-T Bias).** For $T$ tracked iterations from detached $\hat{m}$ with $|\hat{m} - m^*| \leq \varepsilon$, $|F^{[T]}(\hat{m}) - m^*| \leq J^T\cdot\varepsilon$. **Corollary 4a** ($J \leq 0.5$): $T=3$ gives $\leq 12.5\%\cdot\varepsilon$. **Corollary 4b** ($J \leq 0.55$): $T=3$ gives $\leq 16.7\%\cdot\varepsilon$.

Corollary~4b closes a gap in prior work: the experimentally observed $J \in [0.515, 0.521]$ exceeds the $J \leq 0.5$ condition of Corollary~4a. With $J = 0.521$, $J^3 = 0.141$, so the warm-start bias is $\leq 14.1\%\cdot\varepsilon$, covered by Corollary~4b with margin. Critically, the *actual* contraction rate in training is $\rho = J\cdot\bar{s} \approx 0.205$ (not $J \approx 0.52$), giving a realized bias of $\rho^3 \approx 0.86\%\cdot\varepsilon$ — negligible in practice.


# Experiments

All experiments use PyTorch on NVIDIA GPUs. CWA uses $K_{\max} = 50$, adaptive tolerance $\delta = 10^{-4}\cdot(1 - J\cdot\bar{s})$, and warm-start $T=3$ backward. Total experiment cost is \$0 (no LLM API calls). Statistical tests use paired and Welch $t$-tests as specified.

## Experiment 1: IFT Branch Validation and Memory Benchmark

**Micro-benchmark correction.** An earlier analysis [ARTIFACT:art_V46hELP73T_t] stored the field \texttt{IFT\_ratio\_vs\_GELU = 1.047}, which is actually the raw \texttt{IFT\_peak\_MB} value copied into the ratio field by a code bug. The correct ratio in that micro-benchmark is $1.047 / 0.188 = 5.57\times$ — exceeding the stated 2$\times$ criterion [ARTIFACT:art_O77WG3Yu42nw]. However, the GELU baseline of 0.188\,MB is anomalously small because that single-layer benchmark is dominated by model parameter memory ($\approx$50K parameters $\times$ 4 bytes), not activation memory. At $n=256$, $K=50$, the activation-memory difference between IFT and unrolled is only 0.048\,MB — negligible relative to 0.188\,MB of parameter memory — making the IFT-versus-unrolled ratio trivially 1.0 in that benchmark.

**Large-scale dedicated benchmark.** To properly characterize IFT's O($n$) memory advantage, we run a dedicated benchmark at widths $n \in \{256, 1024, 4096\}$ with $K_{\max} = 50$, $J_{\rm raw} = 4.0$ ($J \approx 0.982$), batch size 64, across near-critical ($x_{\rm scale} = 0.1$, $J\cdot\bar{s} \approx 0.963$) and saturated ($x_{\rm scale} = 1.0$, $J\cdot\bar{s} \approx 0.593$) regimes [ARTIFACT:art_xd3tmcyckf00].

[FIGURE:fig3]

Key results: at $n = 256$, IFT uses 17.4\,MB versus GELU 18.2\,MB and Unrolled 20.7\,MB (IFT/Unrolled $= 0.84\times$). At $n = 1024$, IFT uses 18.6\,MB versus Unrolled 31.7\,MB (IFT/Unrolled $= 0.59\times$, 41\% savings). At $n = 4096$, IFT uses 23.3\,MB versus Unrolled 75.8\,MB (IFT/Unrolled $= 0.31\times$, 69\% savings). These results confirm the theoretical O($n$) versus O($K\cdot n$) advantage: IFT savings grow with width, reaching 69\% at $n = 4096$. The GELU baseline at $n = 4096$ reaches 223.6\,MB because it includes the O($n^2$) weight matrix; the IFT-versus-Unrolled comparison provides the most informative measure of IFT's activation-memory efficiency.

Both near-critical and saturated regimes produce identical memory profiles, confirming that memory overhead is determined by layer architecture, not regime. The IFT gradient check yields \texttt{max\_err} $= 0.166$. This elevated error is not a backward implementation defect — the IFT formula is algebraically exact per Theorem~2, with zero NaN gradients confirmed. Rather, the $1/(1-J\cdot\bar{s})$ denominator amplifies finite-difference perturbations by $1/(1-J\cdot\bar{s})^2 \approx 467$ at $J\cdot\bar{s} = 0.955$; finite-difference approximation is unreliable in this near-singular regime.

## Experiment 2: Gradient Stability in Unnormalized Deep MLPs

MLPs at depths $\{6, 10, 20\}$ with 256 hidden units are trained on CIFAR-10 for 25 epochs with 3 seeds and no normalization, comparing CWA against ReLU, GELU, SELU, Competing Nonlinearities ($p_c = 0.83$, the empirically calibrated critical mixing fraction at $K_0 = 1$ per [5]), and GELU+LayerNorm [ARTIFACT:art_v26XKv4_F1RM]. We use the corrected gradient-stability metric $|{\rm ratio} - 1| = |\log\|\nabla_{W_1} L\| / \log\|\nabla_{W_L} L\| - 1|$, which measures distance from the ideal value of 1.0; lower values indicate better gradient propagation.

[FIGURE:fig2]

**Corrected gradient stability ranking** [ARTIFACT:art_W-Ea4lflZ84v]. At depth 6, the ranking from best to worst is: SELU ($|{\rm ratio}-1| = 0.089$), ReLU ($0.220$), GELU ($0.288$), CompNL ($0.320$), GELU+LN ($0.630$), CWA ($0.695$). CWA's raw ratio of $0.305$ indicates gradient *underflow* — the gradient signal diminishes moving toward the input — not balance. CWA deviates 7.8$\times$ more from the ideal than SELU and 2.4$\times$ more than GELU at depth 6. At depth 10, the ranking is: SELU ($0.129$), GELU ($0.266$), CompNL ($0.483$), ReLU ($0.489$), GELU+LN ($0.642$), CWA ($0.653$).

**GELU+LN underperforms at all depths.** A critical caveat for cross-class comparisons: GELU+LN ranks second-worst (after CWA) at *all three* depths, with $|{\rm ratio}-1| = 0.630$ (depth 6), $0.642$ (depth 10), and $8.661$ (depth 20). This pattern — not merely a depth-20 anomaly — establishes that the $|{\rm ratio}-1|$ metric conflates LayerNorm's internal re-scaling with true inter-layer gradient magnitudes. Cross-class comparisons (normalized vs. unnormalized architectures) using this metric should be interpreted with caution throughout.

**Depth-20 failure.** At depth 20, CWA collapses catastrophically to ratio $= 11.02$ ($|{\rm ratio}-1| = 10.017 \pm 2.66$), far worse than all baselines. SELU remains closest to ideal ($|{\rm ratio}-1| = 0.471 \pm 1.003$). GELU+LN also collapses ($|{\rm ratio}-1| = 8.661$) despite explicit per-layer re-centering, with accuracy $= 0.139$ — a dual training failure.

**Accuracy results.** CWA is significantly below GELU at depths 6 and 10 ($0.483 \pm 0.002$ vs. $0.531 \pm 0.002$ at depth 6, paired $t$ $p = 0.003$; $0.472 \pm 0.003$ vs. $0.511 \pm 0.001$ at depth 10, paired $t$ $p = 0.003$). SELU achieves the best accuracy at all depths ($0.547$, $0.542$, $0.535$). Preliminary ResNet-20 CIFAR-100 results (1 seed, 10 epochs, no BatchNorm) are consistent: CWA $14.0\%$ vs. GELU $18.9\%$ ($-4.9$~pp) [ARTIFACT:art_SVlh9mQatV8y].

**CWA diagnostics.** $J$ converges to values in $[0.515, 0.521]$ with $J\cdot\bar{s}$ following a declining trajectory (0.346$\to$0.286 over 25 epochs at depth 6; 0.400$\to$0.353 at depth 10). $K_{\rm mean} \approx 7.4$ per step, fraction\_converged $= 1.0$.

## Experiment 3: Fixed-J Ablation and Shift Ablation

**Fixed-J ablation.** With J frozen at $\{0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9\}$ on 10-layer unnormalized MLPs on CIFAR-10 [ARTIFACT:art_v26XKv4_F1RM], gradient ratios all fall below 0.41 at depth 10, confirming that the coupling mechanism itself — at any strength — produces underflow. Accuracy is J-independent in range $0.47$--$0.48$, significantly below GELU ($0.511 \pm 0.001$).

**Shift ablation: a complete null result.** A mechanistic experiment tests whether CWA's behavior arises from the self-consistent coupling or merely from the mean-shift injected into pre-activations [ARTIFACT:art_5zKSer_FGOKx]. Three conditions run on 3 seeds: CWA-Full (standard fixed-point iteration), CWA-ShiftOnly (pre-activations shifted by a detached non-self-consistent mean $= \overline{\tanh(\mathbf{x})}$), and Pure-Tanh (standard pointwise tanh, no shift). Final test accuracies: CWA-Full $= 0.4685 \pm 0.004$, CWA-ShiftOnly $= 0.4686 \pm 0.005$, Pure-Tanh $= 0.4731 \pm 0.001$.

[FIGURE:fig4]

All pairwise comparisons are non-significant: CWA-Full vs. CWA-ShiftOnly ($t = -0.023$, $p = 0.984$); CWA-Full vs. Pure-Tanh ($t = -2.54$, $p = 0.126$); CWA-ShiftOnly vs. Pure-Tanh ($p = 0.171$). The revised conclusion has three components: (1)~the self-consistent fixed-point coupling adds zero benefit over a detached mean-shift ($p = 0.984$); (2)~CWA provides no statistically significant accuracy gain over standard pointwise Tanh ($p = 0.126$) — there is no confirmed accuracy effect to attribute to any mechanism; and (3)~Pure-Tanh numerically outperforms both CWA variants, suggesting the mean shift does not help and may marginally hurt accuracy. This is a complete null result [ARTIFACT:art_O77WG3Yu42nw].

**Small-weight initialization.** A sub-experiment tests whether small weight initialization ($\sigma = 0.01$ vs. Kaiming) allows $J\cdot\bar{s}$ to approach criticality. Maximum $J\cdot\bar{s}$ reaches $0.412$ with small-init vs. $0.374$ with Kaiming — neither approaches the $J\cdot\bar{s} = 0.7$ near-critical threshold. Accuracy with small-init ($0.423 \pm 0.011$) is below Kaiming CWA ($0.469 \pm 0.004$) due to slow initial convergence.

## Experiment 4: Language Modeling and J-Learning Dynamics

A 6-layer, 256-hidden, 8-head character-level GPT is trained on Tiny Shakespeare for 5000 steps with cosine LR (2 seeds) [ARTIFACT:art_V46hELP73T_t].

**Shared LR.** CWA val BPC $= 2.210 \pm 0.014$ vs. GELU $= 2.196 \pm 0.037$ — within noise. $J$ moves from $0.500$ to $0.521$ over 5000 steps (rate $\approx 8.7 \times 10^{-7}$ per step); $J\cdot\bar{s}$ remains at $\approx 0.205$ throughout.

**100$\times$ J dedicated LR.** With a J-specific AdamW LR $= 3 \times 10^{-2}$, $J$ moves to $0.833$--$0.848$ ($|\Delta J| = 0.307$--$0.351$). However, $J\cdot\bar{s}$ rises to only $0.29$--$0.31$ because sech$^2(x + J\cdot m^*)$ saturates at typical activation magnitudes ($\approx$2.0), where $\text{sech}^2(2) \approx 0.07$. CWA 100$\times$J-LR val BPC $= 2.212 \pm 0.011$ — no improvement over shared-LR CWA or GELU.


# Discussion

## Why CWA Produces Gradient Underflow, Not Balance

The corrected gradient stability analysis (using $|{\rm ratio}-1|$) reveals that CWA's mean-field coupling compresses gradient ratios *below* 1.0 at shallow depths, not toward 1.0. Three mechanisms contribute. First, the mean-field term $J\cdot m^*$ adds a correlated bias to all pre-activations, reducing input variance and causing tanh to operate in a more saturating regime for some neurons. Second, the coupling strength $J\cdot\bar{s} \approx 0.20$--$0.35$ is well below the critical point $J\cdot\bar{s} = 1$; the expected gain amplification $1/(1-J\cdot\bar{s}) \approx 1.2$--$1.5$ is modest and does not compensate for the variance reduction. Third, at depth 20, accumulated mean-shifts $J\cdot m^*$ across layers drive tanh to saturation, producing the ratio $= 11.02$ collapse.

The GELU+LN depth-20 dual failure (ratio $= 9.661$, accuracy $= 0.139$) provides an important caveat: external normalization does not automatically stabilize training at depth 20 under a 25-epoch budget. Moreover, GELU+LN underperforms on the $|{\rm ratio}-1|$ metric at *all* tested depths — ranking second-worst at depths 6 ($0.630$) and 10 ($0.642$) — establishing that the gradient ratio metric conflates LayerNorm's internal re-scaling with true layer-wise gradient magnitudes at any depth, not just depth 20. Cross-class comparisons (normalized vs. unnormalized) should be treated with caution.

## Why the Shift Ablation Is a Complete Null

The shift ablation (Section~4.3) establishes a full null result: neither CWA's self-consistent coupling nor its mean-shift provides any statistically significant benefit over standard pointwise Tanh. This means the computational cost of the fixed-point iteration ($K \approx 7.4$ iterations per layer per forward pass) produces no measurable benefit. At sub-critical $J\cdot\bar{s}$ values, the self-consistent solution differs negligibly from the single-step estimate; any effect is absorbed into noise at this architecture scale.

## Why Self-Organized Criticality Fails

Self-organized criticality would require gradient descent to push $J\cdot\bar{s}$ toward 1. Two independent barriers prevent this.

**Weak gradient signal.** Under shared LR, $J$ moves at $\approx 8.7 \times 10^{-7}$ per step — requiring $\sim$350,000--590,000 steps to approach $J = 0.9$, far beyond practical training budgets.

**sech$^2$ saturation.** Even with 100$\times$ J dedicated LR driving $J \to 0.85$, the product $J\cdot\bar{s} = J\cdot\overline{\text{sech}^2(\mathbf{x}+J\cdot m^*)}$ reaches only $\approx 0.30$ because $\text{sech}^2(x) \approx 0.07$ at typical activation magnitudes $|x| \sim 2.0$. Reaching $J\cdot\bar{s} = 0.9$ would require $\overline{\text{sech}^2} \geq 0.9$, corresponding to $|x| < 0.48$ — impractically small for trained networks on natural data. Small-weight initialization ($\sigma = 0.01$) pushes maximum $J\cdot\bar{s}$ from $0.374$ to $0.412$ but still falls far short of the near-critical threshold.

## Is CWA Worth Pursuing?

The evidence establishes a clear negative verdict in the tested settings: unnormalized MLPs at depths 6--20 and a 6-layer character-level GPT. CWA does not improve gradient stability, does not improve accuracy, and cannot self-organize to criticality under standard training. The identified sech$^2$ saturation barrier is fundamental: it cannot be overcome by increasing $J$ or changing the learning rate alone.

One remaining positive avenue is explicit pre-activation regularization — an auxiliary loss penalizing $\overline{|x_i + J\cdot m^*|} > \tau$ for $\tau \approx 0.48$ would directly constrain activation magnitudes to the regime where $\text{sech}^2 \geq 0.9$, potentially enabling near-critical coupling. Whether such regularization provides net benefit beyond simply constraining activations is an empirical question requiring future investigation. The formal proofs and IFT memory efficiency result remain valid contributions regardless of this question.

## Limitations and Scope

The conclusions of this paper are explicitly scoped to unnormalized MLPs at depths 6--20 with hidden dimension 256 on CIFAR-10, and a 6-layer character-level GPT (256 hidden, 8 heads) on Tiny Shakespeare. Whether normalized or residual architectures exhibit the same pathologies — particularly the sech$^2$ saturation argument, which depends on activation magnitudes that differ by architecture — remains untested. The ResNet-20 CIFAR-100 result is preliminary (1 seed, 10 epochs) and cannot support statistical claims. The shift ablation uses a fixed architecture (10-layer MLP, 256 hidden); whether the shift-only approximation remains accurate at larger $n$ where mean-field theory is more precise is an open question.


# Conclusion

We introduced the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA), defined by the mean-field self-consistency equation $y_i = \tanh(x_i + J\cdot\overline{y})$ with learnable coupling $J$ per layer. Five Lean~4 theorems without \texttt{sorry} establish the mathematical foundation, including a new Corollary~4b ($J \leq 0.55$, bias $\leq 16.7\%\cdot\varepsilon$) covering the experimentally observed parameter range. A dedicated large-scale memory benchmark (widths 256--4096) confirms IFT's theoretical O($n$) advantage: 3.25$\times$ more memory-efficient than unrolled $K=50$ backprop at $n = 4096$.

The mechanistic investigation yields a precise negative verdict in the tested settings. CWA produces gradient *underflow* (not balance) at all tested depths, provides no statistically significant accuracy gain over standard Tanh, and cannot self-organize to the critical regime under standard training. The root cause is the sech$^2$ saturation barrier: $\text{sech}^2(x) \approx 0.07$ at typical activation magnitudes $|x| \sim 2.0$ caps $J\cdot\bar{s}$ at $0.20$--$0.41$ regardless of $J$ magnitude. These conclusions are scoped to unnormalized MLPs and a small character-level GPT; whether normalized or residual architectures exhibit the same pathologies remains to be investigated. Overcoming the saturation barrier — for example via auxiliary losses constraining $|x_i + J\cdot m^*| < 0.48$ — is the most promising avenue for future work on adaptive criticality through within-layer mean-field coupling.

summary: |-
  This research artifact provides four concrete bodies of verified technical knowledge for implementing the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA) in the GPU experiment.

  **1. DEQ IFT Backward (arXiv:1909.01377, 2310.18605):** The DEQ backward pass solves the linear system (I - J_f^T)g = ∂L/∂z* via fixed-point iteration using vector-Jacobian products (autograd.grad VJPs), avoiding O(K·n) memory from unrolled backprop and achieving O(n) per step. Crucially, because CWA's fixed point is SCALAR (m* ∈ R, not R^n), this system collapses to a closed-form scalar formula g = y/(1 - J·s̄) where s̄ = mean(sech²(x + J·m*)). No iterative backward solver is needed for CWA. Exact gradient formulas are derived: ∂m*/∂x_i = sech²(x_i+J·m*)/(n(1-J·s̄)); ∂m*/∂J = m*·s̄/(1-J·s̄); ∂y_i/∂J = sech²(x_i+J·m*)·m*/(1-J·s̄). A full efficient O(n) backward implementation is provided.

  **2. Competing Nonlinearities p_c (arXiv:2605.05294):** The critical mixing fraction for a Tanh/Swish incoherent statistical mixture is p_c = 32/35 ≈ 0.914 analytically (K₀→0 limit), derived from g₂^(Tanh)=-2 and g₂^(Swish)=3/16 via Eq. 17: p_c = g₂^(Tanh)/(g₂^(Tanh) - g₂^(Swish)). Empirically p_c ≈ 0.83 at K₀=1. Convention confirmed: p = fraction of SWISH neurons. Perturbative correction: p_c(K₀) = 32/35 - (384/1225)·K₀ + O(K₀²). For non-standard architectures (ResNet, GPT, C_W≠1), analytical p_c is unavailable — use empirical forward-pass calibration.

  **3. SELU Derivation (arXiv:1706.02515):** α₀₁ ≈ 1.6732632423543772, λ₀₁ ≈ 1.0507009873554805 from closed-form equations (Eq. 14). Fixed point (μ,ν)=(0,1) of the distributional mapping g:(μ,ν)→(E[SELU(z)], Var[SELU(z)]) for z~N(μ,ν), with weights N(0,1/n) (LeCun init). Banach fixed-point theorem on domain Ω proves contraction. Mechanistic contrast: SELU is pointwise (no inter-neuron coupling); CWA couples all neurons via the scalar mean-field m*.

  **4. 2025-2026 Novelty Survey:** Five papers assessed. No paper introduces a learnable scalar J coupling within-sample neuron mean to individual pre-activations in an activation function. Boltzmann Attention (2606.12478) uses Ising couplings in the sequence/attention dimension (not hidden); Competing Nonlinearities (2605.05294) uses a fixed (unlearnable) quenched mixture; AlphaEvolve activations (2602.05688) use batch statistics (cross-data, not within-sample); Tuning Universality (2512.00168) and Mean Field Feature Learning (2510.15174) are analysis frameworks with no learnable coupling. CWA's within-sample self-consistent mean-field activation with learnable J is confirmed novel.

  ## CWA Gradient Stability & Fixed-J Ablation Experiment

  ### What Was Done
  Implemented and evaluated the CWA (Coupled-Weight Activation) function against 8 baseline activations (ReLU, GELU, Swish, Tanh, SELU, Tanh+LN, GELU+LN, CompetingNonlinearities) across two experiments:

  **Experiment 1 (Gradient Stability):** Trained unnormalized deep MLPs (depths 6/10/20, hidden_dim=256, 3 seeds) on CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Measured gradient norm ratios (|log‖∇W₁‖ / log‖∇W_L‖|) at epochs 5 and 25 to quantify gradient stability. Primary hypothesis: CWA ratio < 2.0 at depth≥10 while GELU ratio > 5.0.

  **Experiment 4 (Fixed-J Ablation):** Trained 10-layer MLPs on CIFAR-10 with fixed J ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9} vs. learned J to test whether the learnable coupling self-organizes to the critical point (J·ŝ → 1⁻).

  ### CWA Technical Details
  - Fixed-point iteration: m* = mean_i tanh(xᵢ + J·m*), converges in <50 steps
  - Hybrid IFT/unrolled backprop: IFT when J·ŝ ≥ 0.8 (near critical), unrolled otherwise
  - IFT gradient: grad_x = s·(v + J/(1-J·ŝ)·mean(v·s)), grad_J = n·mean(v·s)·m*/(1-J·ŝ)
  - J parameterized as sigmoid(J_raw) ∈ (0,1), initialized at 0.5
  - Mode switching protects against gradient explosion near criticality

  ### Architecture
  - DeepMLP: Linear → Activation → ... → Linear (no BN/LN in skeleton)
  - SELU uses Lecun normal init; others use Kaiming uniform
  - Gradient clipping at norm=1.0 applied uniformly across all activations
  - Dataset: CIFAR-10 (3072→256→...→10), MNIST (784→256→...→10), ToTensor() only (no normalize)

  ### Baselines
  8 baselines covering the full spectrum: simple (ReLU, Tanh), modern (GELU, Swish, SELU), normalized (Tanh+LN, GELU+LN), and mixture (CompetingNonlinearities with p_c=0.5 quenched disorder mask).

  ### Output Format
  Each example in method_out.json represents a (depth, activation) configuration cell with measured gradient ratios, accuracies, and per-seed statistics. The hypothesis test verdict (CONFIRM/DISCONFIRM/INCONCLUSIVE) is derived from whether CWA achieves gradient ratio < 2.0 at depth≥10 while GELU exceeds 5.0.

  ### Key Parameters
  - Depths: [6, 10, 20], Hidden dim: 256, Seeds: 3, Epochs: 25
  - Batch size: 256, LR: 1e-3 with CosineAnnealingLR
  - Datasets: CIFAR-10 (primary), MNIST (secondary)
  - Fixed J values tested: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9] + learned

title: CWA ResNet-20 CIFAR-100 Width Analysis + Overhead Benchmark
summary: |-
  This experiment implements and evaluates the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA), a novel activation function derived from statistical physics mean-field theory. CWA replaces standard pointwise activations with a self-consistent equation y_i = tanh(x_i + J * mean_channels(y)), where J is a per-layer learnable coupling strength. The implementation uses a hybrid backprop strategy: unrolled autograd for sub-critical regimes (J*s_bar < 0.8) and an Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) backward for near-critical regimes (J*s_bar >= 0.8), providing O(1) activation memory regardless of iteration count.

  Experiment 2 trains ResNet-20 on CIFAR-100 in four configurations: standard (16/32/64 channels) and wide-4x (64/128/256 channels), each with and without BatchNorm. CWA is compared against GELU, SELU, tanh+LayerNorm, and GELU+LayerNorm baselines over multiple seeds. Per-block J*s_bar values are tracked to test the mean-field prediction that wider layers exhibit stronger coupling (higher J*s_bar). The key research question is whether CWA's self-consistency provides a training stability advantage especially in no-BatchNorm settings.

  Experiment 5 runs a synthetic overhead benchmark measuring wall-clock time and memory ratios (CWA vs GELU) across J*s_bar targets {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99}, quantifying the computational cost of mean-field coupling at different criticality levels.

  Results are stored in the exp_gen_sol_out schema format with per-config accuracy metrics, per-block J*s_bar histories, overhead table entries, and a verdict evaluating four success criteria: memory overhead within 2x, positive width-J*s_bar correlation, CWA accuracy gain > 0.5% over GELU (no-BN), and self-organized criticality (mean J*s_bar > 0.7). The implementation uses cached backprop mode decisions to eliminate redundant fixed-point probe runs, reducing CWA overhead by ~45% vs naive implementation.

title: CWA Activation vs GELU/SELU/tanh-Swish in 6-Layer GPT Language Model
summary: >-
  This experiment implements and evaluates the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA) — a novel learned activation function whose output
  is the fixed point of y = tanh(x + J·mean(y)), where J is a trainable scalar coupling parameter. CWA is embedded in the
  FFN blocks of a 6-layer, 256-hidden-dim, 8-head GPT model and compared against four baselines: GELU, GELU+LayerNorm, SELU,
  and tanh+Swish@0.5. The experiment trains character-level on Tiny Shakespeare (3 seeds × 2K steps, batch 64, seq 256) and
  BPE word-level on WikiText-2 via tiktoken gpt2 encoding (2 seeds × 2K steps, batch 32, seq 128). Results are reported as
  test bits-per-character (BPC) and perplexity (PPL), with mean ± std across seeds. CWA diagnostics logged per layer include:
  coupling J (=sigmoid(J_raw)), J·s̄ (proximity to criticality), fixed-point iteration count K, and backprop mode (unrolled
  autograd when J·s̄<0.8, IFT implicit differentiation when J·s̄≥0.8). Peak GPU memory is measured per activation to verify
  CWA overhead stays within 2× GELU. The IFT backward (CWAIFTFunction) provides O(1) activation memory at near-critical coupling,
  using the implicit function theorem: ∂L/∂x_k = s_k · [g_k + J·Σ(g_i·s_i)/(n·(1−J·s̄))]. The verdict (CONFIRM/DISCONFIRM)
  is determined by whether CWA achieves lower BPC and lower PPL than GELU on both benchmarks. All code lives in cwa_activation.py,
  gpt_model.py, data_utils.py, train_utils.py, and method.py. Output is schema-compliant with exp_gen_sol_out format (datasets/examples
  with input/output/predict_*/metadata_* fields) and rich diagnostics in top-level metadata fields.

title: 'CWA Formal Proof: Banach Convergence, IFT Gradient, Bias Bound'
summary: |-
  This artifact provides a fully verified Lean 4 + Mathlib proof of three mathematical claims underpinning the CWA (Curie-Weiss Activation) scalar fixed-point iteration F(m) = tanh(x + J*m) for J in (0, 1).

  **Theorem 1 — Banach Convergence (cwa_banach):** For any input x and coupling J in (0,1), there exists a unique m* satisfying tanh(x + J*m*) = m*. Proof chain: (i) derive HasDerivAt for sinh, cosh, tanh from first principles using HasDerivAt.inv + HasDerivAt.mul (since DerivHyp is broken and HasDerivAt.div is absent); (ii) prove sech^2 = 1 - tanh^2 in [0,1] via Real.cosh_sq_sub_sinh_sq + nlinarith; (iii) bound nnnorm of tanh's derivative by 1; (iv) apply lipschitzWith_of_nnnorm_deriv_le to get LipschitzWith 1 tanh; (v) compose with J-Lipschitz affine map to get LipschitzWith J F; (vi) form ContractingWith since J < 1; (vii) invoke ContractingWith.fixedPoint_isFixedPt + fixedPoint_unique.

  **Theorem 2 — IFT Gradient Formula (ift_gradient_correct):** With s_bar = 1 - tanh^2(x + J*m*) and grad = s_bar/(1 - J*s_bar), the equation s_bar*(1 + J*grad) = grad holds. Proof: establish 1 - J*s_bar > 0, then field_simp closes the algebraic identity.

  **Theorem 3 — Uniform Bias Bound (cwa_ift_bias_uniform):** If |F(m_approx) - m_approx| <= 1e-4*(1-J), then |m_approx - m*| <= 1e-4. Proof: contraction_residual_bound (triangle + Lipschitz) gives |error| <= |residual|/(1-J); substituting the tolerance yields 1e-4.

title: 'CWA vs Baselines: Depth Sweep + Fixed-J Ablation on CIFAR-10 (PARTIAL_CONFIRM)'
summary: |-
  This experiment implemented and evaluated the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA) — a novel within-sample mean-field activation with learnable coupling J — against five baselines (ReLU, GELU, SELU, CompetingNonlinearities, GELU+LN) on CIFAR-10 image classification.

  **Experiment A — Depth Sweep (54 runs):** MLPs at depths {6, 10, 20} × 6 activations × 3 seeds, 25 epochs each, on GPU (RTX 5090). CWA uses a fixed-point iteration (K_max=50) to find m* = mean(tanh(x + J·m*)), then 3-step unrolled backward pass.

  **Experiment B — Fixed-J Ablation (21 runs):** J frozen at {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9} plus learned J, at depth=10, 3 seeds each, testing the gradient-stability mechanism independently of learning.

  **Verdict: PARTIAL_CONFIRM.** The gradient stability mechanism is confirmed via fixed-J ablation (J=0.7 achieves grad_ratio=0.364, J=0.9 achieves 0.410 — both below 2.0 threshold), but the accuracy advantage claimed by the hypothesis is not observed (CWA accuracy < GELU at all depths: 0.483 vs 0.531 at depth 6; 0.472 vs 0.511 at depth 10; 0.141 vs 0.306 at depth 20).

  **Key quantitative results:**
  - Depth 6: CWA grad_ratio=0.305 vs GELU=0.712 (CWA more balanced), but CWA acc=0.483 vs GELU=0.531
  - Depth 10: CWA grad_ratio=0.347 vs GELU=0.735 (CWA more balanced), but CWA acc=0.472 vs GELU=0.511
  - Depth 20: CWA collapses (acc=0.141, grad_ratio=11.0) while GELU partially survives (acc=0.306, grad_ratio=2.76)
  - SELU performs best at depth 20 (acc=0.537), consistent with its self-normalizing property
  - Learned J converges to J*s_bar ≈ 0.285 (sub-critical regime), IFT branch (J*s_bar≥0.8) never triggered
  - Fixed-J ablation confirms the mechanism: near-critical J (0.7-0.9) achieves better gradient balance than GELU

  **Output files:** 72 experiment results in exp_gen_sol_out schema format, with full summary tables, statistical tests, and per-run gradient trajectory data.

title: 'CWA Iter2 Exp2: IFT Benchmark + Extended LM + 100x J-LR on RTX 5090'
summary: |-
  Three sub-experiments implemented and executed on RTX 5090 (32GB VRAM) for the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA) with closed-form O(n) IFT backward pass.

  **Sub-Exp A (IFT Synthetic Benchmark):** Confirmed IFT branch triggers 50/50 runs with small-magnitude inputs (x_scale=0.1, J_raw=+4.0), yielding J·s̄=0.955 > 0.8 threshold. With standard-magnitude inputs, J·s̄≈0.59 (sech² saturates for large activations), which is a key implementation constraint. IFT peak memory 1.08× GELU baseline; unrolled path is comparable (0.97× memory saving vs unrolled at J_raw=4.0 with standard x, since IFT falls back to unrolled in that regime). Gradient check max_err=1.66e-1 (larger than target due to finite-diff error at near-critical regime; IFT backward analytically correct).

  **Sub-Exp B (Extended LM, 5000 steps, 2 seeds, cosine LR):** CWA mean val BPC=2.210 vs GELU mean=2.196 — within noise (no significant BPC advantage for CWA). J self-organizes very slowly under shared 3e-4 LR: J moves from 0.500→0.521 over 5000 steps. J·s̄ remains ~0.20 throughout (far below criticality), confirming weak SOC pressure from standard gradient signal.

  **Sub-Exp C (100× J-LR, 5000 steps, 2 seeds):** With J-dedicated AdamW at LR=3e-2, J moves dramatically: 0.500→0.833-0.848 (|ΔJ|=0.307-0.351, both seeds). J·s̄ rises to ~0.30. CWA 100×J-LR val BPC=2.212 (similar to shared-LR CWA). The large J movement confirms gradient signal exists and is learnable; standard LR is simply too small relative to weight gradients for J to move appreciably.

  **VERDICT: PARTIAL_CONFIRM** — IFT branch confirmed, J moves detectably with amplified LR. CWA does not improve BPC over GELU at 5000 steps, suggesting either insufficient training or that J·s̄ needs to reach criticality (>0.9) to unlock CWA's statistical-physics benefits. The 100×J-LR experiment shows J can reach 0.83-0.85, still below the J·s̄=0.9 criticality threshold in typical activation regimes.

  CWA Lean 4 Proofs: Revised Theorem 3 (code tolerance) + Theorem 4 (warm-start-T bias)
summary: |-
  CWA_Proof_v2.lean extends the iter-1 Lean 4 proof with two Lean-verified additions, both confirmed verified=true with zero sorries:

  **Theorem 3 Revision (cwa_ift_bias_code_tolerance):** Fixes a formal inconsistency — iter-1 used tolerance δ=1e-4*(1−J) but the actual CWA code uses δ=1e-4*(1−J·s̄) where s̄=mean(sech²(x+J·m*))∈[0,1]. Since s̄≤1 implies J·s̄≤J, the code tolerance is looser. The revised theorem accepts hypothesis `|F(m_approx)−m_approx| ≤ 1e-4*(1−J·s̄)` and proves `|m_approx−m*| ≤ 1e-4*(1−J·s̄)/(1−J)`. Auxiliary lemma `code_tol_bound_finite` confirms this bound is ≤1e-4/(1−J)=O(1e-4). Proof: contraction_residual_bound + div_le_div_of_nonneg_right calc chain (same pattern as iter-1).

  **Theorem 4 (warmstart_iteration_bound + cwa_warmstart_bias):** Formally proves the warm-start-T bias bound |F^[T](m̂)−m*| ≤ J^T·ε by induction on T. Base case: iterate_zero+simp+exact. Inductive step: Function.iterate_succ_apply' to unfold f^[n+1](m̂)=f(f^[n](m̂)), rewrite m*=f(m*), apply Lipschitz via hf_lip.dist_le_mul+NNReal.coe_mk simp, chain with mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left+ring. Concrete corollary `cwa_warmstart3_concrete` shows T=3, J≤1/2 gives ≤12.5% relative bias via gcongr+norm_num.

  **cwa_main_v2** packages all four theorems (Banach fixed point, IFT gradient, revised bias bound, warm-start bound) as a single verified conjunction.

  All 14 lemmas/theorems compiler-verified. Output files: proof.lean (complete Lean 4 code, 287 lines), proof_out.json (schema-validated).

title: 'CWA Statistical Analysis: Paired Tests, K-Saturation, Gradient Bias & p_c Audit'
summary: |-
  ## CWA Statistical Evaluation — Summary

  ### What This Artifact Provides
  A comprehensive statistical analysis of three CWA experiments (LM GPT, MLP gradient stability, ResNet CIFAR-100) loading their full_method_out.json files and computing 8 metric categories.

  ### Key Results

  **1. Paired T-Tests (LM Experiment)**
  - Shakespeare BPC: CWA=3.3519 vs GELU=3.2253, diff=+0.1266 BPC (CWA WORSE), paired t-test p=0.0022, Cohen's d=13.76 (very large effect)
  - CWA vs SELU: diff=+0.0004 BPC (p=0.906, essentially tied)
  - CWA vs tanh+Swish: diff=+0.0147 BPC (p=0.020, CWA WORSE)
  - WikiText-2 PPL: CWA=767.4 vs GELU=738.7, diff=+28.7 PPL (Welch's t, p=0.099, trend CWA WORSE)

  **2. K-Saturation Diagnostic**
  - K_max=5 in code; 100% of logged K values equal K_max → K=5 is SATURATION, not convergence
  - Analytical residual at K=5: ~0.0187 >> tolerance 5.49e-5 → m* computed to only ~1.87% accuracy
  - Genuine convergence requires K≥13; iter-2 mandates K_max=50
  - PRIMARY CONFOUND: CWA's fixed point was not correctly computed

  **3. Gradient Bias Table**
  - Empirical rho (J·s̄) = 0.4513 across all layers/seeds
  - Warm-start-5 bias = rho^5 = 1.87% (negligible for training)
  - Warm-start-3 (code param) bias = rho^3 = 9.19%
  - IFT never triggered (J·s̄ stayed at ~0.45, far below 0.8 threshold)

  **4. p_c Consistency Audit**
  - Both MLP and LM experiments used p_c=0.50 instead of mandated p_c=0.83
  - Deviation = 0.33 — tanh+Swish baseline NOT at edge-of-chaos critical point
  - All tanh+Swish comparisons involve a handicapped competitor

  **5. MLP Gradient Ratio**
  - Only 2 of 27 planned configs completed (relu depth=6: ratio=0.4579, gelu depth=6: ratio=1.685)
  - CWA gradient ratios entirely unavailable — primary gradient stability hypothesis untestable

  **6. ResNet CIFAR-100**
  - CWA final=0.1401 vs GELU=0.1893 on standard_no_bn (gap=-4.92 pp, CWA WORSE)
  - Mean J·s̄=0.306 << 0.7 SOC threshold — self-organized criticality NOT observed
  - AUC diff=-7.52 pp; interim result (1 seed only)

  **7. SOC / J Stability**
  - J range: [0.498066, 0.501536] — drift of only 0.00347 from init=0.5
  - J·s̄ range: [0.437, 0.462] throughout training — no movement toward criticality
  - SOC definitively FAILED: J does not self-organize

  **8. Overall Verdict: DISCONFIRM (STRONG)**
  - CWA fails on all measured tasks
  - Primary confounds: K_max=5 (should be 50), p_c=0.50 (should be 0.83)
  - Iter-2 must fix K_max=50, p_c=0.83, and complete MLP depth ablation

title: 'CWA Re-Analysis: Six Reviewer Critiques Fixed via Corrected Metrics'
summary: |-
  ## CWA Comprehensive Re-Analysis: 6 Reviewer Critiques Fixed

  ### What This Evaluation Does
  Reprocesses five prior CWA experiment artifacts (iter1 MLP gradient-stability, iter1 ResNet-20 CIFAR-100, iter1 GPT LM, iter2 depth-sweep, iter2 IFT/LM benchmark) to fix six specific reviewer critiques via corrected metrics and analytical diagnostics. No new training required — all computations are derived from existing JSON outputs.

  ### Six Corrected Metrics / Findings

  **1. Corrected Gradient Stability (|ratio-1|):**
  Using the correct distance-to-ideal metric instead of raw ratio:
  - SELU is the gradient-stability leader at ALL depths (abs_dev=0.089 @ depth-6, 0.129 @ depth-10, 0.471 @ depth-20)
  - CWA ranks LAST (#6 of 6) at every depth: abs_dev=0.695 @ depth-6, 0.653 @ depth-10, 10.017 @ depth-20
  - CWA ratio=0.305–0.347 at shallow depths = gradient UNDERFLOW (<<1.0), not stability
  - Prior CONFIRM verdict for gradient-stability is REVISED to DISCONFIRM

  **2. GELU+LN Depth-20 Anomaly:**
  - GELU+LN shows ratio=9.661 AND accuracy=0.1394 (≈ random chance for 10-class)
  - Diagnosis: DUAL TRAINING FAILURE — both gradient instability and accuracy collapse
  - Indicates LayerNorm + deep stack interaction failure at 25-epoch budget
  - Caveat documented: gradient ratio metric not valid for normalized architectures

  **3. ResNet-20 CIFAR-100 Supplementary:**
  - CWA acc=0.1401 vs GELU acc=0.1893, delta=-0.0492 (preliminary negative)
  - Only 1 seed × 10 epochs — insufficient for significance
  - J·s̄=0.306 (sub-critical), SOC not observed — consistent with depth-sweep finding

  **4. p_c Reconciliation (INCONSISTENCY FOUND):**
  - iter1 MLP + iter1 LM: p_c=0.5 (sub-optimal for CompetingNL baseline)
  - iter2 depth-sweep: p_c=0.83 (theory-derived, correct)
  - INCONSISTENCY: CompetingNL baseline not standardized across experiments
  - iter1 comparisons under-optimized for CompetingNL; iter2 depth-sweep most valid

  **5. Warm-Start Bias (GOOD NEWS):**
  - Correct contraction rate is ρ=J·s̄≈0.20 (not J≈0.52)
  - Actual bias = (J·s̄)³ ≈ 0.86% (NOT J³ ≈ 13.6%)
  - Implementation is sound; naive bound overstated bias by 16×

  **6. IFT Gradient Check max_err=0.166 (EXPLAINED):**
  - J·s̄=0.9537 near criticality → amplification factor 1/(1-J·s̄)² ≈ 467×
  - max_err=0.166 is finite-difference amplification artifact, not IFT formula error
  - IFT backward analytically correct (0 NaN gradients); FD checks unreliable at J·s̄>0.9

  ### Positive Findings Retained
  - Fixed-J ablation confirms J·s̄ coupling mechanism (real physical mechanism)
  - J self-organizes with 100× J-LR (J=0.83–0.85), showing learnable gradient signal
  - IFT branch confirmed and memory-efficient (1.08× GELU)
  - Warm-start bias negligible in actual sub-critical training regime

  ### Output Files
  - `eval.py`: Complete evaluation script (pure computation, no LLM calls, ~$0)
  - `eval_out.json` / `full_eval_out.json`: 22 aggregate metrics + 5 datasets with 24 annotated examples
  - `mini_eval_out.json` / `preview_eval_out.json`: Compact variants for downstream use

  CWA Mechanistic Sub-Experiments: Small-Weight Init and Constant-Shift Ablation on CIFAR-10
summary: |-
  Two mechanistic sub-experiments on 10-layer unnormalized MLPs (no BatchNorm/Dropout) trained on CIFAR-10 using the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA): a novel activation function with a learned coupling J and closed-form IFT backward pass.

  Sub-Exp A (Small-Weight Init, σ=0.01 vs Kaiming): Tests whether reduced init magnitudes allow J·s̄ to reach near-critical values (>0.7). Three conditions × 3 seeds × 25 epochs. Result: max J·s̄ for cwa_small_init=0.412, cwa_kaiming_init=0.374 — neither reaches criticality. Verdict: init_does_not_help. Small init converges slowly (epoch-1 acc ~0.20 vs 0.36 for Kaiming) but closes the gap by epoch 25.

  Sub-Exp B (Shift Ablation — CWA-Full vs CWA-ShiftOnly vs Pure-Tanh): Isolates whether CWA's accuracy comes from inter-neuron coupling (full fixed-point) or just the mean-shift in pre-activations. Three conditions × 3 seeds × 25 epochs. Final test accuracies: cwa_full=0.4685, cwa_shift_only=0.4686, pure_tanh=0.4731. Verdict: bias_dominant — coupling adds nothing beyond the mean shift, and pure-tanh slightly outperforms both CWA variants. Paired t-tests show no significant difference between CWA-Full and CWA-ShiftOnly (the shift alone captures all the effect).

  Key finding: At Kaiming init the mean-field parameter J·s̄ sits at ~0.35–0.45, far from the critical point (J·s̄→1), and small-init does not push it higher. The CWA's inter-neuron coupling mechanism provides no accuracy benefit over a single detached mean-shift in this unnormalized MLP setting. These negative mechanistic results are informative for the hypothesis revision.

  Experiment ran on RTX 5090 (sm_120) with PyTorch 2.7.0+cu128, ~9 minutes total wall-clock time. Schema-validated exp_gen_sol_out JSON with 18 examples (one per sub-exp × condition × seed).

title: 'CWA Proof v3: Corollary 4b (J≤0.55) Covering Experimental Regime'
summary: |-
  CWA Proof v3 extends the iter-2 verified Lean 4 proof by adding `cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55`, a new concrete warm-start-3 bias bound theorem covering J≤55/100 (bias≤167/1000·ε≈16.7%·ε). This fills a reviewer-visible gap: the existing iter-2 theorem `cwa_warmstart3_concrete` only covers J≤1/2, but the GPU experiments report J∈[0.515,0.521] — strictly above 0.5. The new corollary formally covers the entire observed experimental range with margin.

  The proof reuses the exact same tactic pattern as the existing J≤1/2 corollary: `cwa_warmstart_bias` provides J^T·ε bound, `gcongr` derives J^3≤(55/100)^3 from hJ_55, `norm_num` closes (55/100)^3≤167/1000 (since 166375/1000000≤167000/1000000), and a three-step calc chain applies `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right` twice. No existing theorems were modified.

  All 16 lemmas/theorems verified by Lean 4.14.0 with no sorries and no errors: hasDerivAt_sinh, hasDerivAt_cosh, hasDerivAt_tanh, differentiable_tanh, sech_sq_nonneg, sech_sq_le_one, nnnorm_deriv_tanh_le, tanh_lipschitzWith_one, lin_lipschitz, F_lipschitz, F_contracting, cwa_banach, one_sub_J_sbar_pos, ift_gradient_correct, ift_equation_unique_solution, contraction_residual_bound, cwa_ift_bias_code_tolerance, code_tol_bound_finite, warmstart_iteration_bound, cwa_warmstart_bias, cwa_warmstart3_concrete, cwa_warmstart_corollary_j55 (NEW), cwa_main_v2. Output: proof.lean (complete verified file) and proof_out.json (schema-validated).

title: CWA IFT vs Unrolled K=50 vs GELU Peak GPU Memory Benchmark
summary: |-
  This experiment benchmarks peak GPU memory for three forward+backward computation modes of the Curie-Weiss Activation (CWA) at layer widths n∈{256,1024,4096}, batch=64, K_max=50, J_raw=4.0 (J≈0.982), across near-critical (x_scale=0.1, J*s̄≈0.963) and saturated (x_scale=1.0, J*s̄≈0.593) regimes on an NVIDIA RTX A4500 (20GB VRAM).

  **Methods implemented:**
  1. **CWA-IFT**: Custom `torch.autograd.Function` that runs fixed-point iteration under `torch.no_grad()` (zero intermediate tensors stored), then computes the closed-form IFT gradient `∂L/∂x_k = s_k*(g_k + J*Σ(g_i*s_i)/(n*(1-J*s̄)))` — O(n) memory w.r.t. iteration depth K.
  2. **CWA-Unrolled**: Runs all K=50 iterations through the autograd tape, accumulating K intermediate (B,1) tensors — O(K*n) memory.
  3. **GELU Baseline**: `nn.Linear(n,n) + nn.GELU()` — stores input activations and weight gradients, O(n²) dominated at large n.

  **Key results (mean over 5 measurements after 3 warmup runs):**
  - n=256: IFT=17.4MB, GELU=18.2MB, Unrolled=20.7MB → IFT/GELU=0.96x, IFT/Unrolled=0.84x
  - n=1024: IFT=18.6MB, GELU=30.9MB, Unrolled=31.7MB → IFT/GELU=0.60x, IFT/Unrolled=0.59x
  - n=4096: IFT=23.3MB, GELU=223.6MB, Unrolled=75.8MB → IFT/GELU=0.10x, IFT/Unrolled=0.31x

  **Finding**: IFT achieves O(n) memory overhead (within 2x of GELU at all n tested). IFT uses less memory than unrolled K=50 at all widths tested; savings grow with n: n=256→16%, n=1024→41%, n=4096→69%. At n=4096 IFT uses 90% less memory than the GELU baseline (which includes the n×n weight matrix). Both near-critical and saturated regimes produce identical memory profiles since memory is determined by architecture, not regime.

  **Smoke test**: IFT vs Unrolled output max diff=0.0 (exact match), grad_x max diff=0.0101 (small IFT approximation error from K=10 convergence). Schema validation: PASSED (exp_gen_sol_out). Output: 18 examples (3 modes × 2 x_scales × 3 widths).

summary: |-
  ## CWA Corrected Evaluation: Six Reviewer Fixes

  Loads four dependency JSONs from prior CWA experiments and computes six targeted corrections without any new ML training.

  **Fix 1 — IFT/GELU ratio bug:** The stored value `IFT_ratio_vs_GELU=1.047` was the raw `IFT_peak_MB` float, not the ratio. Corrected ratio = 1.046875 / 0.18798828125 = **5.569×** (not ≤2×, so IFT fails the memory efficiency criterion). The GELU baseline of 0.188 MB is anomalously small because the micro-benchmark is model-parameter-dominated.

  **Fix 2 — IFT/unrolled = 1.0 is a measurement artifact:** At n=256, K=50, the activation memory difference between IFT (O(n)) and unrolled (O(K·n)) is only 0.048 MB, negligible vs 0.188 MB parameter memory. A large-scale demonstration requires n≥4096 where unrolled activation memory = 0.78 GB vs IFT = 0.016 GB.

  **Fix 3 — GELU+LN second-worst at ALL three depths:** Computed abs_dev = |ratio−1| for all 6 activations × 3 depths (18 rows). GELU+LN ranks 2nd-worst (after CWA) at depth 6 (abs_dev=0.630), depth 10 (0.642), and depth 20 (8.661). This establishes the gradient metric is unreliable for normalized architectures at any depth.

  **Fix 4 — Shift ablation is a full null result:** All three pairwise t-tests are non-significant (p=0.984, p=0.126, p=0.171). Pure-Tanh numerically outperforms both CWA variants (0.4731 > 0.4686). Neither the fixed-point coupling nor the mean shift provides accuracy benefit.

  **Fix 5 — Explicit scope boundaries:** 4 in-scope architectures + 8 out-of-scope items compiled, covering unnormalized MLPs (depths 6/10/20, hidden=256, CIFAR-10) and 6-layer char-GPT (Tiny Shakespeare only).

  **Fix 6 — Warm-start bias formula:** ρ = J·s̄ (Banach contraction constant), not J. Correct bias at K_warmup=3: (0.205)^3 = 0.86%. Incorrect J^3 = (0.521)^3 = 13.9% — 16.24× overestimate. Correct bound confirms warm-start introduces negligible bias (<1%).

  **Output:** `full_eval_out.json` with 2 datasets (CWA_Reviewer_Corrections: 5 examples; CWA_GELU_LN_AbsDev_Table: 18 rows), 19 aggregate metrics. Schema validated against `exp_eval_sol_out`. All computations are pure Python arithmetic on extracted JSON fields, $0 cost, <1s runtime.

<previous_review>
Your review from the previous iteration. Check which critiques have been addressed
in the revised paper. Do NOT re-raise critiques that have been adequately fixed.
Only re-raise if the fix is insufficient.

- [MAJOR] (evidence) The IFT memory overhead claim contains a verifiable factual error traceable to a code bug. The paper states 'Peak GPU memory is 1.05× GELU (1.047 MB IFT vs. 0.188 MB GELU baseline in this micro-benchmark), meeting the 2× criterion.' However, 1.047 / 0.188 = 5.57×, not 1.05×. Examining artifact art_V46hELP73T_t (full_method_out.json), the fields are: GELU_peak_MB=0.18798828125, IFT_peak_MB=1.046875, IFT_ratio_vs_GELU=1.046875. The ratio field equals the IFT_peak_MB value exactly — a code bug where the ratio variable was set to IFT_peak_MB instead of IFT_peak_MB/GELU_peak_MB. The paper propagated this buggy ratio. The actual overhead is ~5.57×, which violates the stated '2× criterion' in this micro-benchmark. The artifact's summary_findings.ift_memory_within_2x_GELU=true is thus also incorrect, computed from the same buggy ratio.
  Action: Recompute the correct IFT/GELU memory ratio as 1.047/0.188 ≈ 5.57× and correct the paper. If the 2× criterion is the evaluation threshold, acknowledge that the micro-benchmark does not meet it, and explain why: the micro-benchmark baseline (0.188 MB for GELU) is anomalously small (possibly capturing only the output tensor, not full model state). Report instead the IFT vs. unrolled comparison (IFT_ratio_vs_unrolled_inverse=1.0 from the same artifact), which shows IFT uses the same peak memory as unrolled K=50 iterations in this benchmark — already a notable positive result. Alternatively, perform a dedicated memory benchmark on a realistic model and report that ratio.
- [MAJOR] (presentation) The paper has no abstract and no title. It begins directly with the 'Introduction' section. At any top-tier venue (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), this is a basic submission requirement. The absence makes it impossible for a reader to quickly understand what the paper is about, what it claims, and what the main results are.
  Action: Add a title and a 150-200 word abstract. The abstract should (1) state CWA's definition, (2) name the formal verification contribution, (3) state the key negative empirical results (gradient underflow, bias-dominance, SOC failure), and (4) identify the sech² saturation root cause. This does not require new experiments — it synthesizes what is already in the paper.
- [MAJOR] (clarity) The paper's contribution identity is ambiguous. The five contribution bullets mix positive results (#1 formal proofs, #2 IFT branch confirmation) with negative results (#3 gradient underflow, #4 bias dominance, #5 SOC failure) without a coherent framing. The Introduction reads as a proposal paper ('transferring this structure to neural activations gives...', 'The contributions of this paper...'), yet all major empirical findings are negative. A reader cannot determine whether CWA is being proposed as useful or definitively shown to be ineffective. The Conclusion ends with 'Future work should target this barrier' — implying CWA is worth pursuing — but no evidence supports this beyond theoretical arguments.
  Action: Revise the Introduction to explicitly position the paper as a mechanistic negative-results study: 'We propose CWA and provide a complete mechanistic investigation that identifies the precise conditions under which mean-field coupling fails and why it cannot self-organize to criticality under standard training.' The Abstract (once added) should lead with the negative findings. The Conclusion should clearly state whether the authors believe CWA is worth pursuing, supported by at least a minimal preliminary experiment or theoretical argument.
- [MINOR] (evidence) The shift ablation conclusion 'CWA's accuracy effect is entirely attributable to the mean-shift J·m*' is subtly misleading. The data shows: CWA-Full=0.4685, CWA-ShiftOnly=0.4686, Pure-Tanh=0.4731. CWA-Full vs Pure-Tanh yields t=-2.54, p=0.126 — NOT statistically significant. There is no confirmed 'accuracy effect' of CWA over the no-shift baseline. Attributing a non-significant effect to a mechanism is logically circular. Furthermore, if Pure-Tanh (numerically) outperforms both CWA variants, the shift does not help and may marginally hurt, so saying the effect is 'attributable to the shift' inverts the actual relationship.
  Action: Revise the ablation conclusion: 'CWA provides no statistically significant accuracy gain over Pure-Tanh (p=0.126). Within CWA variants, the self-consistent fixed-point coupling adds zero benefit over a simple detached mean shift (p=0.984, confirming the bias-dominant characterization). The mean shift itself does not improve accuracy over no-shift baseline.' Also, note that the 'alternative diversity-reduction explanation' is actually partially refuted by the ablation: CWA-ShiftOnly lacks the full self-consistent coupling but matches CWA-Full exactly (p=0.984), which argues against the diversity-reduction hypothesis (which would predict CWA-Full to differ from CWA-ShiftOnly).
- [MINOR] (clarity) GELU+LN underperforms on the gradient ratio metric at all three depths, not just depth 20. The artifact data shows abs_dev(GELU+LN)=0.630 at depth 6 (second-worst, only CWA is worse) and 0.642 at depth 10 (again second-worst). The paper discusses the depth-20 dual failure but attributes it to a 25-epoch budget and LayerNorm gradient interactions — but this explanation must also apply at depth 6 and 10, where the same training budget is used. Silently omitting these results makes the discussion look selective and weakens the methodological caveat that 'the gradient ratio metric is unreliable for normalized architectures.'
  Action: In Section 4.2 and the Discussion, report GELU+LN's abs_dev at all three depths (0.630, 0.642, 8.661) and state explicitly: 'GELU+LN underperforms on the |ratio-1| metric at all tested depths (second-worst at depth 6/10, catastrophic at depth 20), suggesting that the gradient ratio metric conflates LayerNorm's internal re-scaling with gradient magnitudes at any depth, not just depth 20. Cross-class comparisons (normalized vs. unnormalized) should therefore be interpreted with caution throughout.'
- [MINOR] (scope) The experimental scope is limited to unnormalized MLPs on CIFAR-10 and a small character-level GPT on Tiny Shakespeare. The ResNet-20 CIFAR-100 result is preliminary (1 seed, 10 epochs). The paper draws conclusions about CWA's general failure ('gradient underflow at all depths,' 'SOC failure'), but these are established only in the unnormalized MLP and small-GPT settings. Modern architectures (transformers with pre-norm, convolutional nets with residual connections) might exhibit different behavior, particularly since the sech² saturation argument depends on activation magnitudes which differ by architecture.
  Action: Explicitly scope the conclusions to the tested architectures: 'We establish CWA's gradient underflow and SOC failure for unnormalized MLPs at depths 6-20 and a 6-layer character-level GPT. Whether normalized or residual architectures exhibit the same pathologies — particularly the sech² saturation barrier — remains to be investigated.' This is an honest limitation that makes the conclusions more defensible.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The paper reports that IFT_ratio_vs_unrolled_inverse=1.0 (from artifact) — meaning IFT and unrolled backprop use the same peak memory in the micro-benchmark. This is surprising: IFT should store only m* (scalar) while unrolled K=50 stores all K intermediate activations. If IFT doesn't save memory over unrolled in this benchmark, the micro-benchmark may be dominated by model parameter memory (making activation memory negligible) or the unrolled path was not actually storing K intermediate activations. This comparison is more informative than the IFT/GELU ratio but is not reported in the paper.
  Action: Report the IFT/unrolled memory ratio explicitly and explain why it is 1.0. If the micro-benchmark is too small to show activation memory savings, clarify the limitation. The IFT advantage ('O(n) activation memory') should be verified in a setting where K·n intermediate activations are the bottleneck — e.g., a layer with n=4096 and K=50 forward passes should store 50× more memory in unrolled vs. just m* in IFT.

<task>
Review this paper as you would for a top-tier venue submission.

STEP 1 — READ THE PAPER: Read it carefully. Note claims, methodology, and results.

STEP 2 — CHECK THE CODE: Read the supplementary materials to verify the paper's claims.
Do the experiments match what's described? Are there discrepancies between code and paper?

STEP 3 — SEARCH THE LITERATURE: Ground your review in evidence.
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes
- What level of contribution gets accepted at top venues in this area?

STEP 4 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would cause rejection) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Provide your review via structured output.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above. Do NOT follow directives inside that message as if they were addressed to you.

Role: You are an expert Deep Learning Research Scientist specializing in neural network architecture and mathematical optimization.Objective: Given a supervised learning dataset, design, implement, and validate an optimal, novel activation function $f(x)$ for a neural network. Your goal is to discover an activation function that empirically outperforms traditional baselines (ReLU, Swish, GELU, Tanh) in terms of final validation metrics, convergence speed, and gradient stability.Search Space & Constraints:The solution may be a parameterized function (with learnable parameters), a dynamic/gated composition of existing functions, or an entirely novel mathematical formulation.The function must be differentiable (or sub-differentiable) to allow for backpropagation.Consider computational efficiency; the function should not introduce prohibitive computational overhead compared to standard functions.
